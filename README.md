# Hi there, I'm Pearl! ðŸ‘‹

## Projects
- **[Shopping List App](https://github.com/PearlPhahlane/Module_10R_CS20240132_wfo2407_A1_Pearl-Phahlane_SDF10_R.git)**: In this project, I developed a mobile app that enhanced my CSS and JavaScript skills. By using Firebase for backend services and Scrimba for interactive tutorials, I gained practical experience in mobile app development. The project focused on integrating Firebase features like real-time databases and authentication to build a fully functional app, while also honing my front-end development abilities.
- **[Portfolio Website](https://github.com/PearlPhahlane/Module_7R_CS20240132_wfo2407_A1_Pearl-Phahlane_SDF07_R.git)**: In this project, I followed a guide to fork the Build Your Portfolio MVP starter code from GitHub and then coded along with Scrimba's course using Visual Studio Code (VSCode). By the end of the guide, I had successfully set up a local development environment for working on my Portfolio MVP. This process involved configuring VSCode, understanding the starter code, and integrating it with the Scrimba course materials to develop my portfolio project.
